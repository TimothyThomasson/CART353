## ARTIST STATMENT: 

My Project is currently untitled, and will consist of a collection of different interactive scenarios that make use of the Leap Motion controller. 

The boundaries that are classically put in place to define the differences between video games, interactive experiences, and interactive artworks are being blurred at an increasing rate. My project attempts to embrace the notion of interaction for the sake of interaction. This project is comparative to a toy like a slinky as there is no inherent goal or objective defined within the interaction of the work. The amusement will come from simply wanting to experiment and play around with the leap motion on the part of the user. The project will lack any sort of instruction or guide for the user to follow. Thus, experimentation is a main theme of this work and is something that is encouraged. The use of the Leap Motion controller allows users to play with natural motions that make sense from real world experiences. This makes the experimentation feel less contrived as the actions the user is performing will seemingly make sense for the scenario. 

One of the main allures of this piece can be found within the quantity of experiences that will be available upon the projects completion. The random selection of scenarios from this large pool will leave the user engaged and surprised at the next experience they face. 
The visual style of this project will be based around a sort of “in-progress” aesthetic and make use of common computational and media tropes. This speaks to the prevalence of screens in modern culture, and examines a life time many of us have faced growing up surrounded by computers and screens. For example, it will make use of common icons we see in programs like photoshop, or play with dialogue boxes in a simulated computer desktop.
